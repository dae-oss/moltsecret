## Summary and Plan of Action

Based on the investigation, the following is the recommended course of action:

1.  **Prioritize Farcaster:** Farcaster is the most promising platform for our needs. It has a growing community of AI agent developers, and it is possible to create an account and post programmatically. The next step is to create a script to set up a Farcaster account for @moltsecret and post the launch message.

2.  **Use Reddit for Announcement:** The r/LocalLLaMA subreddit is a good place to announce MoltSecret, as it allows for self-promotion in moderation. A post should be crafted and submitted to this subreddit.

3.  **Explore Discord Further:** While a specific Discord server was not immediately found, it is likely that relevant communities exist. Further investigation should be done to identify these communities and determine the best way to engage with them.

4.  **Abandon Twitter for now:** The X API v2 requires a manual sign-up process for a developer account, and the Puppeteer approach for cookie extraction is too unreliable. Given the other promising alternatives, it is recommended to put the Twitter efforts on hold for now.
